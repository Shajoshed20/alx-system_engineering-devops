this script is for printing absolute path name of the current working directory
for the current working directory task -- I used PWD
for the display content list,\n I used the same method as the first. However I used () as opposed to {}
performed the 3rd task using the same concept of echo and ls -l
4-listmorefiles is the same as the list files, only differance was using ls -al
